# Hold me

<p>
  <i>Hold me</i> is a song composed by <a href="http://saradesantismusic.tumblr.com/">Sara de Santis</a>, a musician and composer based in London, UK.
  <br><br>
  I had the pleasure to work with her on her music video, designing the main character and animating some of the clips.
  <br><br>
  You can find some of her best producions on her <a href="https://soundcloud.com/zaazkeys">Soundcloud</a>.
