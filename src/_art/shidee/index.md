# Shidee

<p class="work-description">
<i>Shidee </i>is an RPG story game, masterless, for two players. The game tells the story of a young boy/girl and a wolf, and their travel together.
Shidee is written by  <a href="https://www.fabriziobotto.games/">Fabrizio Botto</a> <br> and distributed in Italy by <a href="https://www.terradeigiochi.it/">Terra dei giochi</a>. The International Version release is scheduled for early 2019.
<br>
I designed the characters and the environments of the game as well as produced the final illustrations of the manual.
<br>
