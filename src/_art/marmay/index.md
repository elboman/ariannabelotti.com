# Marmay

<p class="work-description">
This paint was made in my on my flight to San Francisco, (well I had to fill 12 hours) and it was initially created for Mermay (a social contest for drawing a mermay in each day of May).
<br><br>
I decided later on to share my paint process in order to help others: I learned everything on drawing and painting by myself thanks to other people who share their knowledge, so I thought to give something back.
You can find it on my IGTV!
