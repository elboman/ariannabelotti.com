# Freedom in Thought

<p class="work-description">
<i>«Freedom in Thought (FiT) is a curation of timeless and pragmatic ideas, from some of the greatest thinkers and doers in history, mixed with some subjectivity.»</i><br>
<br>
I designed, illustrated and animated a 2-part video based on the essay: <em>Why is the School System Failing? The Future of Education</em><br>
